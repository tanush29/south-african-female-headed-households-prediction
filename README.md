# south-african-female-headed-households-prediction

The business objective is to build a predictive model that accurately estimates the percentage of households per ward in South Africa that are female-headed and living below a particular income threshold, by using data points that can be collected through other means without an intensive household survey. This solution can potentially reduce the cost and improve the accuracy of monitoring key population indicators such as female household headship and income level in between census years.
